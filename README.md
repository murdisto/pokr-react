## Description
  Pokr is a sleek, lightning-fast, and no-frills web application that poker players can utilize after each poker-playing session. Upon completion of a session, the player will enter the required information and Pokr will store that information and then display each past session's information in an easy to read format. This will allow the player to see how much money a he or she has won or lost per hour during each session and the ability to spot trends in their results.
